# Zynq-TX-UTT
> TX about image processing to evaluate hardware acceleration performance on a Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC ZC702

In this report and associated Vivado source code, we try to evaluate the hardware acceleration perfomance of the Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC ZC702 using image processing functions in C++, synthesised into HDL block IP with Vivado HLS and implemented on an ARM+FPGA interconnected architecture.
